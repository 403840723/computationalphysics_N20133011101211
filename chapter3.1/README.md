>-  This passage researches the effect of power index in this second-order differential equation ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%5E%7B2%7D%7D%20x%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%5E%7B2%7D%7D%3D-kx%5E%7B%5Calpha%20%7D) on the relatin between amplitudes and periods of oscillations.Basically,when the power index is great than 1, the periods of an oscillation will decrease with the increase of amplitudes,which is different from the situation when the power index is 1 in which the period is independent of amplitudes.
